It's time to have a **whale** of a time.

> Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## Introduction

This repo is a set of personal notes, code snippets, and a spellbook of frequent command invocations that I've collected over time. Shared from me to you!

As I mainly deal with robotics applications, some sections might focus on that, but quite a lot of this reference will generalise outside of the robotics domain! **But as I use Docker with Ubuntu, I cannot guarantee generalisability across other systems or distributions**.
